        Finding the right exam centre or a quiet place to study used to mean
        digging through forums, group chats, and a dozen browser tabs. StudyMap
        pulls all of it onto one free, open map so the next student does not have
        to start from scratch.

          and issues, so the map gets more accurate every time a student helps
