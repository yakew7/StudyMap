# Changelog

All notable changes to StudyMap are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-11

First public release.

### Added

- Exam calendar page (`/calendar`): next 4 international SAT administrations,
  IB Nov 2026 + May 2027 sessions, Cambridge IGCSE June 2026 + Oct/Nov 2026
  series: exam windows and result dates, each cited to the official board.
- Student docs: GitHub Student Developer Pack guide
  (`/docs/github-student-pack`) with official citations.
- Google-Maps-style scroll behavior on the map: plain scroll scrolls the page,
  Ctrl/Cmd + scroll zooms the map, with a hint overlay.
- Theme-aware Leaflet UI: popups, tooltips, zoom controls, and attribution now
  follow the app's light/dark theme.
- Live place count in the hero, computed from the dataset.
- Mobile filter panel redesigned as a bottom sheet with backdrop and close
  button.

### Changed

- Curated the places dataset (80 → 53): removed helipads, seaplane terminals,
  hospitals, closed businesses, mislabeled entries, and low-value small shops;
  kept the 5 most important railway stations.
- Map popups restyled to match the design system; popup links are white on an
  amber CTA with WCAG-compliant contrast in both themes.
- README rewritten for the open-source launch (badges, features, roadmap,
  changelog links).

### Removed

- Stale design-system HTML from the repo root (moved to `docs/`).
- Stray local files that should never have been tracked.

### Security

- Removed accidentally committed SSH key files from the working tree.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

Internal milestone: Places-only scope.

### Changed

- Narrowed scope to map + places + contribute + legal. Removed resources,
  student-docs, contact, and auth features (decision 2026-06-11; superseded
  for student-docs by 1.0.0, which reintroduces a single curated guide).
